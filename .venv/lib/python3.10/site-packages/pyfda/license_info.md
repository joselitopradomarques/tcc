### Licenses ###
The **pyFDA source code** is published under a permissive **MIT license** at the Github repository
[chipmuenk/pyfda](https://github.com/chipmuenk/pyfda) and at [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/pyfda/), 
Icons (except the pyFDA icon itself) are taken from the ["Open Iconic"](https://useiconic.com/open/) collection 
(MIT license).

The **self-contained pyFDA package** (bundled e.g. with the help of pyInstaller or as a flatpak) is published under a **GPLv3 license** 
as it bundles some components with (L)GPL licenses, requiring an 
[(L)GPL compliant license](https://velovix.github.io/post/lgpl-gpl-license-compliance-with-pyinstaller/). 
See also [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/License_compatibility) on license compatibility.

While [pyInstaller](https://www.pyinstaller.org/) itself is distributed under a GPLv2 licence, 
the bundled pyFDA package only contains the pyInstaller bootloader which has a permissive license.
